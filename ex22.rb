# So this lesson blows the big fat one.
# I mean it really blows
# It blows like a whale getting a much needed breath


# this is a comment intended to document what code is doing

# Math is next

+ # this is a plus sign for adding
= # this is a equals sign for sumingthings up
/ # this is a dividing symbol
* # this is a multiplication symbol
- # this is a subtrction symbol
** # exponential, this is for using the concept of exponential numbers
% # this is modulo, I fucking hate this stupid fucking symbol. it divides the left by the right and return a remainder. Fuck you modulo, fuck you.


+= # this will take the current variable on the left and add the variable on the right to the first variable
/= # this will take the current variable on the left and divide it by the variable on the right
-= # this will take the current variable on the left and subtract the variabel on the right from it
*= # this will take the current variable on the left and multiply it by the variable on the right
%= # this is the same as above but using modulo. Again, fuck you modulo
**= # exponential power mutation for original variable

# comparisons.... sigh. aka true or false

==  # a true or false return, if a = and b = 1 does a == b ? yes, yes it does
!=  # the exact fucking opposite from the above
>   # is the left greater then the right?
<   # is the right greater then the left?
>=  # is the left greater or equal to the right?
<=  # is the right greater or equal to the left?
<=> # this is space ship. this thing returns -1 if right is greater 0 if left and right are equal and 1 if left is greater

# Some other stuff

# puts  # this is to return a string to the cli or to the web form
# print # print this thing out
# def   # defines a function
# end   # ends a method of other function
# if    # portion of the if this then that comparitive 
# elsif # portion ""
# else  # portion ""
